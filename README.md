# üèÄ EuroLeague Player Stats ‚Äì Scraping, Cleaning & Visualization

This project collects, processes, and visualizes EuroLeague player and team stats from 2016‚Äì2025 using web scraping and Tableau.

## üîç Project Purpose

## üì¶ What‚Äôs Included

- **Python notebooks** for scraping player, team, and game data from the official EuroLeague site.
- **Cleaning and transformation** steps to handle missing data, team suspensions (e.g., Russian teams in 2022), and multi-team seasons.
- **Raw JSON** and **processed CSV** files (excluded via `.gitignore`) to separate scraped content from final analysis-ready data.
- A **Tableau dashboard** to interactively explore players' performance and rankings.
